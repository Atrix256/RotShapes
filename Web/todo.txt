* make a web page that lets you draw in black / white and converts it to a rot encoded image
* make it show the pixels for the encoded rot image
* have it decode the rot image to show you what it looks like decoded.

* separate code into multiple files?

* better paint tools in creator?
 * copy/paste (for multi frames)
 * load image (for source or encoded panel)

* multiple encoded frames in one image (for sprite sheets and animation)

* be able to animate the preview (result)

* for some reason, i can't seem to put alpha into the encoded texture ):

* show size (in bytes) of source and encoded images

=====
Later...
* a playground to investigate the properties of the image (scale, zoom, tint, anti aliasing, etc)
 * in webgl?

* show shader code to decode rot images, based on options selected!

* a playground that lets you layer multiple tinted (and animated?) layers?

* see how this holds up to dxt compression (maybe jpg too?)

=====NOTES=====

? what should happen if result isn't square but source is.  Should it stretch?
 ! this is controlled by however the UV coordinates are set up.

? fill tool in encoder?
 ! there is no flood fill in javascript/html5 so would need to code it by hand.  image important should be good enough.
