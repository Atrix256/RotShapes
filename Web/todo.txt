* make a web page that lets you draw in black / white and converts it to a rot encoded image
 * make it show the pixels for the rot image

* make it so you can load an existing image into the drawing area

* have it decode the rot image to show you what it looks like decoded.
 * maybe able to scale it up or something?

* make sure you can download / save the images drawn to / created

* make it so you can choose how big the source image is

* separate code into multiple files?

* better paint tools in creator?
 * undo
 * paintbrush size
 * pauntbucket
 * choose between draw / erase
 * copy/paste (for multi frames)
 * clear
 * load image (for source or encoded panel)

* multiple encoded frames in one image (for sprite sheets and animation)

* be able to animate the preview (result)

=====
Later...
* a playground to investigate the properties of the image (scale, zoom, tint, anti aliasing, etc)

* webgl version?

* share shader code to decode rot images
