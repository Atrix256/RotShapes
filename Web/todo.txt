* make a web page that lets you draw in black / white and converts it to a rot encoded image
* make it show the pixels for the encoded rot image
* have it decode the rot image to show you what it looks like decoded.

* separate code into multiple files?

* better paint tools in creator?
 * mode: draw, fill
 * copy/paste (for multi frames)
 * load image (for source or encoded panel)

* multiple encoded frames in one image (for sprite sheets and animation)

* be able to animate the preview (result)

=====
Later...
* a playground to investigate the properties of the image (scale, zoom, tint, anti aliasing, etc)
 * in webgl?

* share shader code to decode rot images
